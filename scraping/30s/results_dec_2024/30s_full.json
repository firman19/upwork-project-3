    "description": "Job DescriptionAre you interested in relocating to one of South East Asia’s most vibrant and dynamic cities? Want to teach your passion rather than ESL? We need Maths, Science, English Literature and Primary level teachers! Instead of ESL teaching, tutors can share their passion for their degree subjects or build experience in the education field teaching across the world’s best known international curricula. Tutors will also have the opportunity to build close relationships with their students, growing their confidence, overseeing their achievements and ultimately transforming their educational futures. The International Tutor Group (ITG) is a Tutoring Agency rather than a school, providing academic and mentoring support to students from Vietnam’s best international schools. All you need is a flair for your subject, a strong degree, and preferably some experience working with young people. ITG is offering both full and part-time positions in Vietnam’s emerging hub of Ho Chi Minh City. We’re on the hunt for experienced tutors who can support leading international school students at Primary Level or up to IGCSE and International Baccalaureate (IB) / A-Level. You’ll have flexible working hours and still be able to dedicate time to your personal projects or simply enjoy Vietnamese local life. ITG is a British run company specializing in academic support for all international curricula. We’re a small, family-style setup with about 20 teachers working mostly 1-1 and in small groups in our relaxed Study Centre. Tutors will have the opportunity to make lasting and effective relationships with their students in a supportive professional environment. ITG offers extensive training and curriculum guidance from international school teachers with years of experience. When you arrive in HCMC we’ll help organise every aspect of your stay from accommodation to your work permit and residency card. Positions are available from 6 to 18 months, starting from August 2019. It is only our opinion, but we think there has never been a better time to be in Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City). Drenched in history, Saigon is a city in the midst of a mind-boggling transformation. New skyscrapers, hip international bars and buzzing arts venues appear on an almost weekly basis. This is set amongst the last vestiges of a sleepy French Colonial past and the utterly distinctive quality of traditional street life, with its bustling coffee shops and mouthwatering food vendors. Our gorgeous Study Centre is located in a leafy suburb just a short hop from the city centre, so you’ll be sure to make the most of it all whilst having ample space to relax.",

At more than 20 campuses across Vietnam as well as Thailand, we offer engaging courses designed for all ages and abilities. In July of 2010, AMA signed a cooperative agreement worth $3 million (USD) with Cleverlearn Vietnam. Cleverlearn Vietnam is an affiliate of Cleverlearn, Inc., a leading and reliable worldwide provider of English language training founded in the U.S. In 1999. Cleverlearn, Inc. Established the Vietnam branch in Ho Chi Minh City in 2003. In February of 2012, Cleverlearn Vietnam – HCM Branch officially merged with and was renamed the American Academy. This new entity has been approved by both the National Office of Intellectual Property of Vietnam and the Ho Chi Minh City Department of Education and Training. At the time it acquired Cleverlearn (Vietnam), the American Academy introduced and embraced the corporate slogan, “Care & Success” as an expression of the culture and core values that animate AMA and all who are associated with the company.

By unifying the programmatic assets of these previously separate enterprises, the newly emerged AMA is well situated and provisioned to seek fresh avenues for its innovative approaches to teaching and learning. The corporate merger of February 2012 has also set in motion the exploration of and planning for the delivery of authorized undergraduate and graduate education, as well as research and program development both in the field of linguistics and in the area of English language instructional methodology (with a specific scholarly focus on the Active Learning model, the innovative and powerful instructional methodology developed and employed by AMA). Since early 2011, AMA has established and maintained formal strategic partnerships with a cadre of internationally prominent and respected institutions and educational organizations. Among the company’s partners are: – The British Council, including status as an official IELTS Examination Center – Cambridge ESOL Examination Centers.
