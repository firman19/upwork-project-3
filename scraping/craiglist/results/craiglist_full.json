Position comes with healthcare, paid time off, and other benefits. Given our current team makeup and this young man’s personal care needs, he is interested in hiring a male candidate. Starting rate of pay is $21-$23 per hour depending on experience and medical/academic background.  Specific weekly hours are negotiable (together, the DSP team covers 6am to 10pm, 7 days a week). The DSPs support a person entirely interested in being a part of all life has to offer, but needs 1:1 support to do so. Roles and responsibilities require an applicant to be comfortable with providing personal care (bathroom, showering, etc), social support, technological support, and working with a team approach in mind. Maintaining dignity and respect through all care and support is paramount. Daily responsibilities include supporting this young man’s active social and recreational life in the community, and employment support. Social support involves spending time with friends, grabbing lunch, and going on adventures.  This young man is a part-time college student, has two jobs, and is a filmmaker. Following Boston sports and NASCAR are  among his biggest passions. He has been hoping to date and find a relationship. This is a rewarding job within a close-knit, busy family that wants to help their son – who experiences significant mobility, communication, and health challenges – have the engaging life he desires.  He is very interested in hiring a DSP who is also a big fan of sports, in particular college and professional football, baseball, basketball and NASCAR. Some health care background is helpful. Clean criminal and driving records are a must.  A wheelchair accessible vehicle is provided during support hours. Candidates must be vaccinated against COVID 19 and commit to annual flu shots.  The position begins as soon as mid/late July, starting with extensive training. Selected candidates will be invited for an in-person interview.",
