Several studies and survey results reported at major Maintenance and Reliability conferences have confirmed this. A maintenance department can be far more productive in so many ways, becoming proactive instead of responding to emergencies like fire departments. Maintenance departments should be performing preventive and condition-based maintenance tasks, participating in process improvement projects, and working on capital improvement initiatives. Maintenance workers can upgrade their skills, train others, and educate operators to run the assets properly to minimize errors.",
