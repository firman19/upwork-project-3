This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.\nAn education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.

The grounds are expansive and provides for active and passive play as well as a chicken enclosure and vegetable gardens. The full size gymnasium and indoor canteen ensure a range of indoor activities are encompassed in daily learning opportunities. The school's mission is to provide a welcoming and challenging environment that fosters respectful and responsible global citizens capable of thriving in the future. We hope our students graduate as knowledgeable, skilled, confident, and critical thinkers through the school being a centre of excellence committed to sharing best practice. Our key values demonstrate our shared and relentless commitment to implementing our mission so that our vision becomes a living reality. We value Respect: We show we care about ourselves, others and the environment through our actions and words. Responsibility: We do the things we are supposed to do, own, and accept the results of our actions and words. Persistence: We keep trying, even when things seem hard, and know when to seek help. Kindness: We use actions and words to make others feel happy, or when we notice they need help. The enrolment currently sitting around 165 students. Student Family Occupation (SFO) index in 2024 is 0.71 and the Student Family Occupation and Education Index was also high. This characterises the school as a low socio-economic school community. We have one student funded by the Program for Students with Disabilities (PSD) and another three who qualify for DI Funding. 18 ATSI students, 5 in Out of Home Care and 63 with a Karen background. The school went through a School Review mid 2022, which was a wonderful celebration of the gains it had made in all areas of school improvement. The leadership team consists of a Principal, Acting Assistant Principal, and 2 Leading Teachers; with Ls & AP holding teaching roles at the school. Homegroups are taught by 10 teachers, 2 part-time Intervention teachers/tutors and 4 specialist teachers. Nine Education Support Officers (ES) supported students across the school. The school's specialist programs are Visual Arts, Music and Physical Education and a Languages program in Karen with the assistance of our Multi Cultural Aides. The school enjoyed strong ties with the Greater City of Bendigo Council who sponsor local businesses to participate in an aspirational work program called Passions and Pathways (P&P) targeting Year Six students. The school also had strong ties with both the Eaglehawk and Bendigo Sandhurst Rotary Clubs, with Bendigo Sandhurst Rotary Club leading a weekly volunteer gardening program. The club also donated fresh fruit weekly that complemented our daily breakfast club. The school maintained positive community partnerships that supported our students and their families. The school accesses DET Speech Pathologists, Psychologists, Occupational Therapists and Koorie Education Support Officers, supplementing our own speech aide and a qualified Social Worker, employed as our PWO (0.6) to complement these services using Equity funds. A major success in 2022 was the introduction of a designated Student Attendance and Wellbeing LT. This substantial commitment via Equity funding saw a total review of processes to track student absences, work closely with the Regional Team and families to support students to attend school on a regular basis. Although our Attendance Data remained a challenge, the newly developed Staged Response to Non-Attendance will provide us with a clear implementation strategy for future years. Equity funding has been allocated to allow the Wellbeing Leading Teacher to promote and oversee SWPBS and teach RR&RR across the school, support additional ESS, release a second Leading Teacher to manage Disability and Inclusion at a whole-school level and release a Literacy leader to provide additional lessons to our EAL students.",

The English programmes at YK are one-on-one, meaning that students have sessions that are appropriate for their ability and the specific issues they have in class. As a tutor, I could also build a more personal relationship with each student and encourage them to feel confident in asking questions and identifying areas that they struggle with. Everyone at YK from staff to students is friendly and familiar with each other…To me, this supportive environment is a great asset of YK and key to helping struggling students reach their full potential.”“…From the beginning of this year, I’ve also worked at YK Education as an English tutor and continue to learn about what an amazing tutoring experience is offered here. I can appreciate how we tailor our tutoring for each student in order to create the best learning experience, as well as the emphasis on creating environments that are comfortable and welcoming for the students. As an employer, Yuna gives huge support to tutors and is always helpful and making sure we’re on the right track.”“As a relief mathematics tutor since 2019, I have not once felt unprepared or out of place even for last-minute arrangements due to the highly organised lesson planning, resource management and communication between staff. YK has created a friendly learning environment that not only excels in developing rapport with students but also pushes them to achieve their academic goals.

The College was founded in 1954 in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of McKinnon. The main campus on McKinnon Road caters to Years 7, 10, 11 and 12. In 2022, a second campus was opened at the nearby Virginia Park site off East Boundary Road dedicated to Years 8 and 9.\nMcKinnon Secondary College is an accredited school with the Council of International Schools and strives to prepare its students to thrive in a world which values interpersonal skills as much as academic excellence. McKinnon does not believe in a `one size fits all¿ education and offers a positive, caring and safe learning environment in which all students can achieve success through its comprehensive and differentiated curriculum, and an extensive extra-curricular program.\nMcKinnon Secondary College lives by its motto `Wisdom and Service¿ by actively promoting a culture that celebrates the achievement of excellence, that values and respects individual diversity and that encourages participation by all members of the community. Students at McKinnon are very conscious of the opportunities being offered to them and take pride in themselves and the College. Student voice is valued at the College as is student welfare. Mindfulness is factored into the daily routine with positive benefits. Student achievements are formally recognised and celebrated in College publications, at whole school assemblies, on the school¿s website and at the annual Presentation Assembly.\nThe College¿s positive culture, high expectations and rigorous teaching and learning program have consistently translated into excellent VCE results. These factors have maximised tertiary educational opportunities with over 95% of our students going on to study at university. In addition, VCAL provides an applied learning pathway for students. Aside from a reputation for academic excellence, McKinnon also has well-regarded art, music and sporting programs, as well as an impressive array of extra-curricular offerings. Our students regularly participate in community events and festivals, and represent the school at regional, state and national level. The richness of the College program allows students to flourish as they pursue their particular interests and goals.\nMcKinnon Secondary College values the unique contributions graduate teachers bring to the learning experience, whilst recognising the period of adjustment these teachers face when entering this dynamic profession. In recognition of this, McKinnon employs two Learning Specialist Coaches, dedicated to supporting the needs of graduate teachers.\nThese Learning Specialist Coaches support graduate teachers through scheduled coaching sessions, classroom observations and assistance through the VIT registration process. This provides a safe space for these educators to learn from, and receive targeted feedback from experienced specialist teachers, accelerating their development toward dynamic, effective and confident teaching professionals.\nMcKinnon has established itself as an IT leader in the education space, being recognised as Australia¿s first Google Reference School. IT has become central to the school¿s learning programs and administration. With the opening of the new campus the school is further investing in STEAM-focused technologies.\nThe College has always relied on the commitment of its parent body through which the school council has provided support for teaching programs and facilities. With the addition of the new East Campus and the construction of the impressive new gymnasium at the Main Campus, the College has high-quality sporting facilities, a Lecture Theatre, and attractive ground spaces for students to socialise and be active.\nThe McKinnon school community is determined to meet the challenges of the modern world with a continuing commitment to our core values.",

This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.\nAn education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.\nCertification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).\nA role at this range may include:\nSpecific support tasks to achieve outcomes.

At our school, teachers learn to be excellent practitioners developed by a pipeline of leaders. We have an exceptionally strong induction program for staff joining the College that serves both experienced and beginning practitioners.\nWe have a whole-school approach to curriculum, where strong practitioners invest in writing strong curriculum which allows teams and individual teachers to spend less time working out ‘what’ to teach and more time focussing on ‘how’ to teach the content in a way that is highly effective for their specific students.\nWe believe that if we invest in every staff member to support them to be their best, our students will be best-placed to thrive.

Our instructional model LEARN is based on the Marzano/Pollock GANAG model and is used with fidelity in our classrooms.

John Fawkner Secondary College is a growing co-educational secondary college, which operates within a distinct geographical area with a diverse cultural mix.\nIn 2024, JFC will see two significant changes which highlight the way forward. Firstly, a large part of the school will be demolished to make way for two new buildings: a new Science/STEAM, Arts and Media, and technology wing, which will also house staff members, and a new VET Hospitality grade kitchen classroom and canteen. There will also be significant landscaping within this development.\nThe second major change for 2024 is the partnership with Melbourne Victory Soccer Club, who will roll out the first pilot team by the second half of the year. Over coming years, the program will grow progressively, opening up to students from across the district.\nThe school is in a transform stage and is currently experiencing significant change and improvement, across curriculum, learning, and wellbeing. The School Strategic Plan has a strong focus on improving learning through the use of our well documented and viable curriculum and the JFC Instructional Model. Student wellbeing and engagement is supported by the SWPBS framework, and this is reflected in the school values. Each year from 7-10 has a coordinator, supported by a Sub School Leader. VCE and VM students are supported by a Year 11 coordinator and a Senior School Leader.\nThe college has a strong focus on improving Literacy and Numeracy, and students are identified for support through the Quicksmart program, MYLNS, and the tutor learning initiative. The funded PSD students are supported in the classroom by integration aides and a PSD coordinator. The college boasts a strong wellbeing team, consisting of a full time wellbeing leader, a school nurse, art therapist, and mental health practitioner. Our growing areas currently are in Outdoor Ed, Bike Ed, and PE across all levels as sport is a sought after career pathway for many students.\nThe students from years 7 ¿ 10 study the Victorian Curriculum and electives. At year 10, students are counselled to appropriate pathways and select from VCE/VM to continue their final years of schooling. The college has rewritten the VM curriculum to be in line with the VCAA reforms through the Firth report and the students are exposed to the Applied Learning Pillars as their framework for learning. All VM students do a Vet subject one day a week, and there is the potential to study a SBAT whilst at school.\nThe staff at JFC is collegiate and collaborative, led by an executive principal and two assistant principals. The focus is on the future for the students in this area and we seek vibrant, innovative, committed teachers and leaders to join us in our journey of improvement and success. Tours are welcome from prospective employees.\nOur Vision:\nThe schools motto is ¿Aspire and Achieve¿ with the vision statement, ¿John Fawkner College takes pride in uniting learners from a diverse community within a respectful and adaptive environment that fosters enjoyment in learning and the motivation to achieve excellence.¿\nOur Values:\nRespect: We respect others for who they are and value their opinions\nCommitment: We are dedicated to our values, our school and our community\nAcademic Excellence: We relentlessly pursue academic excellence\nContinuous Improvement: We never stop finding ways to stretch and grow",

This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.\nAn education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor.

Our values inform our daily interactions and decisions, these values are embedded in our whole school practice and they are supported by the high expectations that embody our School-wide Positive Behaviour Support Program.\nSince 2020, we have transformed our approach to learning by enabling students to be more empowered to take control of their learning. We are committed to embedding an education model that is more student¿centred and focused on personalised learning pathways. We have redesigned our learning programme to enable students to excel through this research-based future-focused model, ensuring all of our students benefit from deepened learning and improved educational outcomes. In line with this approach is our recognition that all students are unique, and that each student brings their own distinct and individual passions, interests, skills, and knowledge into our learning ecosystem.\nOur world is rapidly changing and so must our approach to learning. Sir Ken Robinson reminds us that Schools Kill Creativity. Professor Yong Zhao suggests that education requires a `Paradigm shift¿. In 2019, HPSC joined Future Schools and commenced redesigning our curriculum and our approach to learning to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Learning is categorised into three stages or `programmes¿: Explore, Enhance, and Excel. These programmes recognise the unique needs of each student as they engage in their secondary education and allow learning to be transformative, dynamic, and focussed upon growth. Our programmes allow students to `move through¿ their secondary schooling experience in a way that better reflects their passions and abilities rather than their nominal `year level¿. Hence, whilst many students merely survive their time at high school, students at HPSC instead thrive in an exceptional learning environment where they are empowered and supported to create an educational pathway that is as individual and unique as they are.\nAt HPSC, we strive to create a culture of learning that enables learning to be done with students, rather than to students. Our innovative, tailor made approach to learning assists students so that no student is held back, and no student is left behind. Learning is an organic process. By creating optimal conditions for learning, students thrive.\nHPSC is a large, culturally diverse learning community situated in the City of Casey growth corridor. The current student enrolment stands at 1144 students with approximately 52 nationalities represented and 67 languages other than English spoken. Sixty percent of students speak a language other than English at home, 27% of students are enrolled in English as an Additional Language (EAL) and 66% of students receive additional equity funding. There are 5 Principal Class, 116 Teacher Class and 70 Educational Support Staff.\nWe are seeking exceptional educators and support staff to join our highly professional and dedicated team to transform learning. If you believe that an innovative approach is needed to engage students and improve outcomes, while better preparing them for a rapidly changing world, then I encourage you to apply to join our dynamic team.

That is our families, staff and community all working together to support our young people, and our students leaning on these support networks to achieve their best.\nAlthough we are a big school able to cater for more than 2,200 students, we have been able to retain a `small school¿ atmosphere through our House and Neighbourhood structure. Through this model, our students are able to feel a sense of Greater Belonging by having a house to call home.

GSSC Wellbeing Officers are also based in each neighbourhood to support students on a day-to-day basis.\nThis team around the learner is further strengthened by our Ngarri Ngarri team, made by of six staff and a Team Leader who work across neighbourhoods to support First Nations students and their families. Our Multicultural Liaison Officers (MLO) provide this same support for our Culturally and Linguistically Diverse families and speak a range of languages including Arabic, Dari, Persian, Hazaragi, Swahili, Kirundi and Samoan. Both teams work in and outside of the classroom to promote active student participation, positive family engagement, a proactive home/school partnership, culturally safe learning environment and inclusive curriculum and teaching and learning practices.\nOur Wellbeing and Inclusion Hub also including a range of external allied health and education agencies working in school to support students.
