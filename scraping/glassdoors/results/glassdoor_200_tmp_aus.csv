Location: North West Region | Bendigo
Job type: Part time / From 15/07/2024 - 20/12/2024
Organisation: Schools (Government)
Salary: Salary not specified
Occupation: Teacher
Reference: 1419150
Selection Criteria
SC1 Demonstrated capacity to perform duties consistent with established guidelines and frameworks, including coordinating and supporting others in respect to specific work functions relevant to the role.
SC2 Demonstrated capacity to work and collaborate with others in a team environment.
SC3 Demonstrated capacity to communicate effectively in a team environment, including high level oral and written communication skills.
SC4 Possess the technical knowledge and expertise relevant to the position, including an ability to communicate in Karen.
SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management and other school staff in respect to the work area.
SC6 A commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
Role
Attendance requirement for this position: Monday to Friday 9 - 12.45
Successful candidate will be required to communicate in Karen and translate accordingly.
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provides routine support for teachers including assisting with planning of student routines
Supports communication between teachers and parents
Communicates with teachers on routine matters related to students and/or other responsibilities
Provides basic physical care and wellbeing support for students such as toileting, meals, and lifting
Communicating with student/s to support comprehension of basic tasks and information
Addresses immediate behavioural presentations relating to specific students within a classroom setting aligned to school policy and procedure
Provides basic support and supervision for individuals or groups of up to 4 students within a classroom setting
Supports teachers in the coordination of educational programs independently or under minimal supervision, including rostering and organising the work of a team of aides, providing routine co-ordination, guidance, and support to other student support staff, liaising with external providers of support services about clearly defined support needs and resources, assisting teachers with the communication of student outcomes and educational programs
Provides medical intervention support to a student/s, under specific conditions, with appropriate training and guidance
Provides specialised communication support for students and teachers in areas such as AUSLAN and braille
Who May Apply
Individuals with the aptitude, experience and/or qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of the position.
EEO AND OHS Commitment
Applicants seeking part-time employment are encouraged to apply for any teaching service position and, if they are the successful candidate, request a reduced time fraction. Such requests will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to the operational requirements of the school.

Location Profile
Lightning Reef Primary School boasts outstanding open planned facilities and large grounds beside Bendigo Showgrounds. The grounds are expansive and provides for active and passive play as well as a chicken enclosure and vegetable gardens. The full size gymnasium and indoor canteen ensure a range of indoor activities are encompassed in daily learning opportunities. The school's mission is to provide a welcoming and challenging environment that fosters respectful and responsible global citizens capable of thriving in the future. We hope our students graduate as knowledgeable, skilled, confident, and critical thinkers through the school being a centre of excellence committed to sharing best practice. Our key values demonstrate our shared and relentless commitment to implementing our mission so that our vision becomes a living reality. We value Respect: We show we care about ourselves, others and the environment through our actions and words. Responsibility: We do the things we are supposed to do, own, and accept the results of our actions and words. Persistence: We keep trying, even when things seem hard, and know when to seek help. Kindness: We use actions and words to make others feel happy, or when we notice they need help. The enrolment currently sitting around 165 students. Student Family Occupation (SFO) index in 2024 is 0.71 and the Student Family Occupation and Education Index was also high. This characterises the school as a low socio-economic school community. We have one student funded by the Program for Students with Disabilities (PSD) and another three who qualify for DI Funding. 18 ATSI students, 5 in Out of Home Care and 63 with a Karen background. The school went through a School Review mid 2022, which was a wonderful celebration of the gains it had made in all areas of school improvement. The leadership team consists of a Principal, Acting Assistant Principal, and 2 Leading Teachers; with Ls & AP holding teaching roles at the school. Homegroups are taught by 10 teachers, 2 part-time Intervention teachers/tutors and 4 specialist teachers. Nine Education Support Officers (ES) supported students across the school. The school's specialist programs are Visual Arts, Music and Physical Education and a Languages program in Karen with the assistance of our Multi Cultural Aides. The school enjoyed strong ties with the Greater City of Bendigo Council who sponsor local businesses to participate in an aspirational work program called Passions and Pathways (P&P) targeting Year Six students. The school also had strong ties with both the Eaglehawk and Bendigo Sandhurst Rotary Clubs, with Bendigo Sandhurst Rotary Club leading a weekly volunteer gardening program. The club also donated fresh fruit weekly that complemented our daily breakfast club. The school maintained positive community partnerships that supported our students and their families. The school accesses DET Speech Pathologists, Psychologists, Occupational Therapists and Koorie Education Support Officers, supplementing our own speech aide and a qualified Social Worker, employed as our PWO (0.6) to complement these services using Equity funds. A major success in 2022 was the introduction of a designated Student Attendance and Wellbeing LT. This substantial commitment via Equity funding saw a total review of processes to track student absences, work closely with the Regional Team and families to support students to attend school on a regular basis. Although our Attendance Data remained a challenge, the newly developed Staged Response to Non-Attendance will provide us with a clear implementation strategy for future years. Equity funding has been allocated to allow the Wellbeing Leading Teacher to promote and oversee SWPBS and teach RR&RR across the school, support additional ESS, release a second Leading Teacher to manage Disability and Inclusion at a whole-school level and release a Literacy leader to provide additional lessons to our EAL students.","$78K - $80K (Glassdoor Est.)","Bendigo","Schools (Government)","https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Overview/Working-at-Department-of-Education-and-Early-Childhood-Development-Victoria-EI_IE657347.11,75.htm"

Location Profile
McKinnon Secondary College is a Year 7 to 12 co-educational school with a student population of over 2500. The College was founded in 1954 in the south-eastern Melbourne suburb of McKinnon. The main campus on McKinnon Road caters to Years 7, 10, 11 and 12. In 2022, a second campus was opened at the nearby Virginia Park site off East Boundary Road dedicated to Years 8 and 9.
McKinnon Secondary College is an accredited school with the Council of International Schools and strives to prepare its students to thrive in a world which values interpersonal skills as much as academic excellence. McKinnon does not believe in a `one size fits all¿ education and offers a positive, caring and safe learning environment in which all students can achieve success through its comprehensive and differentiated curriculum, and an extensive extra-curricular program.
McKinnon Secondary College lives by its motto `Wisdom and Service¿ by actively promoting a culture that celebrates the achievement of excellence, that values and respects individual diversity and that encourages participation by all members of the community. Students at McKinnon are very conscious of the opportunities being offered to them and take pride in themselves and the College. Student voice is valued at the College as is student welfare. Mindfulness is factored into the daily routine with positive benefits. Student achievements are formally recognised and celebrated in College publications, at whole school assemblies, on the school¿s website and at the annual Presentation Assembly.
The College¿s positive culture, high expectations and rigorous teaching and learning program have consistently translated into excellent VCE results. These factors have maximised tertiary educational opportunities with over 95% of our students going on to study at university. In addition, VCAL provides an applied learning pathway for students. Aside from a reputation for academic excellence, McKinnon also has well-regarded art, music and sporting programs, as well as an impressive array of extra-curricular offerings. Our students regularly participate in community events and festivals, and represent the school at regional, state and national level. The richness of the College program allows students to flourish as they pursue their particular interests and goals.
McKinnon Secondary College values the unique contributions graduate teachers bring to the learning experience, whilst recognising the period of adjustment these teachers face when entering this dynamic profession. In recognition of this, McKinnon employs two Learning Specialist Coaches, dedicated to supporting the needs of graduate teachers.
These Learning Specialist Coaches support graduate teachers through scheduled coaching sessions, classroom observations and assistance through the VIT registration process. This provides a safe space for these educators to learn from, and receive targeted feedback from experienced specialist teachers, accelerating their development toward dynamic, effective and confident teaching professionals.
McKinnon has established itself as an IT leader in the education space, being recognised as Australia¿s first Google Reference School. IT has become central to the school¿s learning programs and administration. With the opening of the new campus the school is further investing in STEAM-focused technologies.
The College has always relied on the commitment of its parent body through which the school council has provided support for teaching programs and facilities. With the addition of the new East Campus and the construction of the impressive new gymnasium at the Main Campus, the College has high-quality sporting facilities, a Lecture Theatre, and attractive ground spaces for students to socialise and be active.
The McKinnon school community is determined to meet the challenges of the modern world with a continuing commitment to our core values.","$90K - $128K (Glassdoor Est.)","Melbourne","Schools (Government)","https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Overview/Working-at-Department-of-Education-and-Early-Childhood-Development-Victoria-EI_IE657347.11,75.htm"

Role
[Attendance requirement for this position]
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provides routine support for teachers including assisting with planning of student routines
Supports communication between teachers and parents
Communicates with teachers on routine matters related to students and/or other responsibilities
Provides basic physical care and wellbeing support for students such as toileting, meals, and lifting
Communicating with student/s to support comprehension of basic tasks and information
Addresses immediate behavioural presentations relating to specific students within a classroom setting aligned to school policy and procedure
Provides basic support and supervision for individuals or groups of up to 4 students within a classroom setting
Supports teachers in the coordination of educational programs independently or under minimal supervision, including rostering and organising the work of a team of aides, providing routine co-ordination, guidance, and support to other student support staff, liaising with external providers of support services about clearly defined support needs and resources, assisting teachers with the communication of student outcomes and educational programs
Provides medical intervention support to a student/s, under specific conditions, with appropriate training and guidance
Provides specialised communication support for students and teachers in areas such as AUSLAN and braille

Teachers at Whitefriars College are primarily teachers of students rather than subjects.

These students, as individuals, have different strengths and weaknesses, and different intellectual, psychological, emotional and spiritual needs. Recognition of this leads not only to good pedagogy, but is consistent with the sentiments expressed in our mission statement. Relationships based on mutual respect, multi-dimensional curricular and co-curricular programs, multi-faceted pastoral care, and well-conceived priorities, policies, protocols and procedures are all pivotal in encouraging the optimal development and growth of the various individuals in our care. Hence such factors must be the responsibility of all teachers at our school.

The nexus between the role of the teacher and the holistic development of the students in our care highlights the need to have all teachers take ownership of, and collective responsibility for, all programs, policies, protocols and types of interactions at Whitefriars.

It is expected of all employed at Whitefriars College that they accept and support the ethos of the Carmelite order, and activities directed at the broader aims of the College (eg the Carmelite mission in Timor-Leste).


Whitefriars College is a Child Safe School.

Do you have a passion for promoting equity, diversity and inclusion in teacher education? Do you want to make a contribution to knowledge through research?

Monash Education is offering two related PhDs projects on the topic of the cultural diversity of preservice teachers. This is an important topic in the current context when i) there remain ongoing concerns about the whiteness of the teaching profession; ii) preservice teachers from diverse backgrounds often report feeling marginalised; iii) in some teacher education there is a reduction of focus on race, culture, gender and social class and iv) there are new incentives to recruit teachers into a precarious profession, yet we don't know how these recruitment efforts are impacting teachers from diverse backgrounds.

2 x PhD scholarships for full-time research at postgraduate level. The award is available to applicants intending to undertake a PhD with a focus on the cultural diversity of preservice teachers.

We are offering the following two PhD projects under this broader theme:

Preservice teacher diversity, with a focus on investigating the professional transition of PSTs from ethnic/culturally diverse backgrounds into the first year of teaching. This could include recruiting final-year PSTs (from ethnic/culturally diverse backgrounds) just before they graduate from ITE and following them through the first year of teaching in school. Supervisors will be Dr Sun Yee Yip and Associate Professor Megan Adams
Using participatory action research to investigate how a selected group of preservice teachers and young people from culturally diverse backgrounds can learn from each other to strengthen how cultural knowledge can inform the improvement of teacher education. Supervisors will be Dr Denise Chapman, Associate Professor Laura Alfrey and Professor Jo Lampert

The awardees will be determined by a panel in a merit-based selection process.

There is some flexibility regarding the date of commencement.

Candidate Requirements

To be eligible you must:

Be a domestic candidate
Have the necessary qualifications, such as a research masters or honours year to meet the selection requirements into the doctoral program (see Monash University PhD entry requirements)
Be enrolling full time and on campus
Not already hold a PhD

Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are encouraged to apply.

Role
Attendance may be required for up to 6 days during school holiday periods. A leave purchase of 72.47% of the hourly rate will be paid for any additional attendance undertaken during the school holiday periods.
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provides routine support for teachers including assisting with planning of student routines
Supports communication between teachers and parents
Communicates with teachers on routine matters related to students and/or other responsibilities
Provides basic physical care and wellbeing support for students such as toileting, meals, and lifting
Communicating with student/s to support comprehension of basic tasks and information

Provides basic support and supervision for individuals or groups of up to 4 students within a classroom setting
Supports teachers in the coordination of educational programs independently or under minimal supervision, including rostering and organising the work of a team of aides, providing routine co-ordination, guidance, and support to other student support staff, liaising with external providers of support services about clearly defined support needs and resources, assisting teachers with the communication of student outcomes and educational programs
Provides medical intervention support to a student/s, under specific conditions, with appropriate training and guidance
Provides specialised communication support for students and teachers in areas such as AUSLAN and braille

Individuals with the aptitude, experience and/or qualifications to fulfill the specific requirements of the position.
EEO AND OHS Commitment
Applicants seeking part-time employment are encouraged to apply for any teaching service position and, if they are the successful candidate, request a reduced time fraction. Such requests will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis and will be subject to the operational requirements of the school.
The Department of Education is committed to the principles of equal opportunity, and diversity and inclusion for all.

They are required to support students on individual or group basis and to assist the educational services being provided to students within a targeted project framework.
Assisting teachers to understand the home cultures and the expectations families have of the school and of education in general is an integral part of this role as is the improvement in the exchange of information and liaison and communication between school, parents and members of the wider school community.
Range 3 is distinguished by the introduction of management responsibility and accountability for the delivery of professional support services. The role will usually impact beyond the work area or professional field. It seeks to gain cooperation of other staff members or members of the school community to achieve specific objectives, such as in school administration, operations or educational programs.
Direction on targets and goals is provided but the position will have some degree of latitude in determining how they are achieved. This latitude will generally be limited by standard procedures and school policy. Deviation from standard procedures and school policy will require guidance and direction from senior management.

Staff management issues will be resolved with minimal reference to senior management, although guidance will be required in more complex cases.

Role
Monday - Friday
8.45am - 3.15pm
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Assist students on an individual or group basis in specific learning areas.
Assist with the communication between students and teachers, particularly the interpretation of instructions.
Provide basic physical and emotional care for students.
Participate in team meetings.
Assist with toileting, meals, lifting, and administration of medication to students requiring special care.
Assist with the supervision of pupils in playgrounds, at camps, on excursions, in sporting activities, therapy activities and life skills.
Assist in the preparation of student resources and equipment.
Prepare basic curriculum support resources.
Set up and put away equipment and materials in support of teaching programs.

areas such as classroom assistance, gardening, yard duty, administrative support, catering, canteens and the

of a student's experience in the College. Students attend the College knowing they have the complete support and

commitment of their parents behind them.

SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management and other school staff in respect to the work area.
SC6 A commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
Role
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provide routine clerical or other administrative support responsibilities including general telephone, front office enquiries, mail deliveries, assisting with stock control, supporting organisation of meetings, receiving and initial processing of standard paperwork
Maintain, enter and retrieve data from the schools IT systems, such as the school's records system, including computerised student, staff and school records

Berwick College is an embedded part of the local community, striving to prepare its students to thrive in a world which values interpersonal skills as much as academic excellence.

Job type: Part time / From 15/07/2024
Organisation: Schools (Government)
Salary: Salary not specified
Occupation: Teacher
Reference: 1418737
Selection Criteria
SC1 Demonstrated capacity to perform duties consistent with established guidelines and frameworks, including coordinating and supporting others in respect to specific work functions relevant to the role.
SC2 Demonstrated capacity to work and collaborate with others in a team environment.
SC3 Demonstrated capacity to communicate effectively in a team environment, including high level oral and written communication skills.

SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management and other school staff in respect to the work area.
SC6 A commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
Role
[Attendance requirement for this position]
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provides routine support for teachers including assisting with planning of student routines
Supports communication between teachers and parents
Communicates with teachers on routine matters related to students and/or other responsibilities
Provides basic physical care and wellbeing support for students such as toileting, meals, and lifting
Communicating with student/s to support comprehension of basic tasks and information
Addresses immediate behavioural presentations relating to specific students within a classroom setting aligned to school policy and procedure
Provides basic support and supervision for individuals or groups of up to 4 students within a classroom setting
Supports teachers in the coordination of educational programs independently or under minimal supervision, including rostering and organising the work of a team of aides, providing routine co-ordination, guidance, and support to other student support staff, liaising with external providers of support services about clearly defined support needs and resources, assisting teachers with the communication of student outcomes and educational programs
Provides medical intervention support to a student/s, under specific conditions, with appropriate training and guidance
Provides specialised communication support for students and teachers in areas such as AUSLAN and braille

Location Profile
We believe that our students flourish when we create an environment of high support and high expectations. We focus on learning, wellbeing, and their interconnectedness above all else.
Our staff are united by moral purpose. We come to work each day in service of our community. We are deeply connected to our work because of, not in spite of, the challenges that young people face.
Our school serves 1400 students with a team of more than 170 staff. Each one of them are known and noticed. We see partnership with families as critical to our students’ success. We believe that together, our community has everything that our young people need to thrive in life.
We pride ourselves on a strong staff culture that fosters psychological safety with strong relationships, agreed trademark behaviours and genuine conversations about what matters most. Our trademark is not just a statement, it is enacted. We model and reward trademark behaviours in each other and we challenge when we let them slip.
Melton Secondary College is a place of growth for our staff in both teaching and leadership. At our school, teachers learn to be excellent practitioners developed by a pipeline of leaders. We have an exceptionally strong induction program for staff joining the College that serves both experienced and beginning practitioners.
We have a whole-school approach to curriculum, where strong practitioners invest in writing strong curriculum which allows teams and individual teachers to spend less time working out ‘what’ to teach and more time focussing on ‘how’ to teach the content in a way that is highly effective for their specific students.
We believe that if we invest in every staff member to support them to be their best, our students will be best-placed to thrive. In 2024 we are introducing a 9-day face-to-face fortnight option for our staff. This will allow them to benefit from a non-student contact day in their fortnight, creating opportunities for flexible work and regular opportunities for recharging and for deep thinking and reflection.
We use best-practice models to ensure deep learning. Our instructional model LEARN is based on the Marzano/Pollock GANAG model and is used with fidelity in our classrooms. Our resource management systems are supported by partnerships with Office365, Compass and Apple through our Year 7-9 iPad program. A BYOD program is offered to our Year 10-12 students.
Students begin the day connecting in with themselves and each other in a 6-minute morning circle as part of our Social Emotional Learning program.
We have opportunities for staff who are passionate about being highly impactful teachers who lead learning. Currently we are deepening our work with a focus on writing and social emotional learning assessment. We are also actively supporting opportunities for new and existing staff to promote extracurricular programs in the Performing Arts, Sport and Rugby Academy, the VCE Vocational Major, and Student Leadership.","$85K - $115K (Glassdoor Est.)","Melbourne","Schools (Government)","https://www.glassdoor.com.au/Overview/Working-at-Department-of-Education-and-Early-Childhood-Development-Victoria-EI_IE657347.11,75.htm"

Location Profile
John Fawkner College takes pride in uniting learners from a diverse community within a respectful and adaptive environment that fosters enjoyment in learning and the motivation to achieve excellence. John Fawkner Secondary College is a growing co-educational secondary college, which operates within a distinct geographical area with a diverse cultural mix.
In 2024, JFC will see two significant changes which highlight the way forward. Firstly, a large part of the school will be demolished to make way for two new buildings: a new Science/STEAM, Arts and Media, and technology wing, which will also house staff members, and a new VET Hospitality grade kitchen classroom and canteen. There will also be significant landscaping within this development.
The second major change for 2024 is the partnership with Melbourne Victory Soccer Club, who will roll out the first pilot team by the second half of the year. Over coming years, the program will grow progressively, opening up to students from across the district.
The school is in a transform stage and is currently experiencing significant change and improvement, across curriculum, learning, and wellbeing. The School Strategic Plan has a strong focus on improving learning through the use of our well documented and viable curriculum and the JFC Instructional Model. Student wellbeing and engagement is supported by the SWPBS framework, and this is reflected in the school values. Each year from 7-10 has a coordinator, supported by a Sub School Leader. VCE and VM students are supported by a Year 11 coordinator and a Senior School Leader.
The college has a strong focus on improving Literacy and Numeracy, and students are identified for support through the Quicksmart program, MYLNS, and the tutor learning initiative. The funded PSD students are supported in the classroom by integration aides and a PSD coordinator. The college boasts a strong wellbeing team, consisting of a full time wellbeing leader, a school nurse, art therapist, and mental health practitioner. Our growing areas currently are in Outdoor Ed, Bike Ed, and PE across all levels as sport is a sought after career pathway for many students.
The students from years 7 ¿ 10 study the Victorian Curriculum and electives. At year 10, students are counselled to appropriate pathways and select from VCE/VM to continue their final years of schooling. The college has rewritten the VM curriculum to be in line with the VCAA reforms through the Firth report and the students are exposed to the Applied Learning Pillars as their framework for learning. All VM students do a Vet subject one day a week, and there is the potential to study a SBAT whilst at school.
The staff at JFC is collegiate and collaborative, led by an executive principal and two assistant principals. The focus is on the future for the students in this area and we seek vibrant, innovative, committed teachers and leaders to join us in our journey of improvement and success. Tours are welcome from prospective employees.

Role
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time.

Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.
Responsibilities
Provides routine support for teachers including assisting with planning of student routines

Communicates with teachers on routine matters related to students and/or other responsibilities
Provides basic physical care and wellbeing support for students such as toileting, meals, and lifting

Selection Criteria
SC1 Demonstrated capacity to perform duties consistent with established guidelines and frameworks, including coordinating and supporting others in respect to specific work functions relevant to the role.
SC2 Demonstrated capacity to work and collaborate with others in a team environment.
SC3 Demonstrated capacity to communicate effectively in a team environment, including high level oral and written communication skills.
SC4 Possess the technical knowledge and expertise relevant to the position.
SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management and other school staff in respect to the work area.
SC6 A commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
Role
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.

Role
Annual Leave
A full-time employee is entitled to 152 hours (20 days) annual leave in respect of each twelve months of service and accrues progressively during a year of service according to the employee's ordinary hours of work. Part-time employees receive annual leave entitlements on a pro rata basis calculated according to the time fraction worked.
Additional paid leave - education support class
A full-time education support class employee is entitled to 228 hours (30 days) additional paid leave in respect of each calendar year. Part-time employees receive additional paid leave entitlements on a pro rata basis calculated according to the time fraction worked.
An education support class position at this range will perform tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice, and school policy under supervision and direction. This may include coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students but must not include duties of a teacher as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students can be required individually or in groups up to 4 in controlled circumstances and where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.
Certification and/or qualifications of up to three years can be required at this level (noting that Registered Nurse is not included at this level, the first level for which is Level 1 range 3).
A role at this range may include:
Specific support tasks to achieve outcomes. Typically, this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the co-ordination of a work area under the direction of the principal or a manager.
Assisting teachers, within an educational program, by undertaking specific support tasks or the coordination of the support function.
Supervised health and wellbeing support tasks, medical intervention support tasks, or other specialised student/teacher support roles (e.g. enrolled nurses performing the role as described in schedule 3). These roles require specific qualifications and/or training, including roles where further training must be undertaken from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose, for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science, and information technology would be typical examples.
An education support class position at this range commencing at the base will initially be limited to undertaking routine tasks that are carried out under close supervision and direction. Work that carries some degree of independence will generally involve a limited number of tasks performed on a regular basis where priorities are clear, procedures are well established, and direction is readily available. Subject to any specific qualification and/or training requirement, an education support class employee employed in this range may be progressively required to undertake coordination, specialised student/teacher support tasks, or technical tasks as experience in the role is gained.

Location Profile
At Hampton Park Secondary College (HPSC) our vision of learning excellence is underpinned by the HPSC values of Respect, Learning, and Working Together. Our values inform our daily interactions and decisions, these values are embedded in our whole school practice and they are supported by the high expectations that embody our School-wide Positive Behaviour Support Program.
Since 2020, we have transformed our approach to learning by enabling students to be more empowered to take control of their learning. We are committed to embedding an education model that is more student¿centred and focused on personalised learning pathways. We have redesigned our learning programme to enable students to excel through this research-based future-focused model, ensuring all of our students benefit from deepened learning and improved educational outcomes. In line with this approach is our recognition that all students are unique, and that each student brings their own distinct and individual passions, interests, skills, and knowledge into our learning ecosystem.
Our world is rapidly changing and so must our approach to learning. Sir Ken Robinson reminds us that Schools Kill Creativity. Professor Yong Zhao suggests that education requires a `Paradigm shift¿. In 2019, HPSC joined Future Schools and commenced redesigning our curriculum and our approach to learning to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Learning is categorised into three stages or `programmes¿: Explore, Enhance, and Excel. These programmes recognise the unique needs of each student as they engage in their secondary education and allow learning to be transformative, dynamic, and focussed upon growth. Our programmes allow students to `move through¿ their secondary schooling experience in a way that better reflects their passions and abilities rather than their nominal `year level¿. Hence, whilst many students merely survive their time at high school, students at HPSC instead thrive in an exceptional learning environment where they are empowered and supported to create an educational pathway that is as individual and unique as they are.
At HPSC, we strive to create a culture of learning that enables learning to be done with students, rather than to students. Our innovative, tailor made approach to learning assists students so that no student is held back, and no student is left behind. Learning is an organic process. By creating optimal conditions for learning, students thrive.
HPSC is a large, culturally diverse learning community situated in the City of Casey growth corridor. The current student enrolment stands at 1144 students with approximately 52 nationalities represented and 67 languages other than English spoken. Sixty percent of students speak a language other than English at home, 27% of students are enrolled in English as an Additional Language (EAL) and 66% of students receive additional equity funding. There are 5 Principal Class, 116 Teacher Class and 70 Educational Support Staff.
We are seeking exceptional educators and support staff to join our highly professional and dedicated team to transform learning. If you believe that an innovative approach is needed to engage students and improve outcomes, while better preparing them for a rapidly changing world, then I encourage you to apply to join our dynamic team.

Although we are a big school able to cater for more than 2,200 students, we have been able to retain a `small school¿ atmosphere through our House and Neighbourhood structure.

GSSC Wellbeing Officers are also based in each neighbourhood to support students on a day-to-day basis.

SC2 Demonstrated capacity to assist students in a school setting.
SC3 Demonstrated high level oral and written communication skills.
SC4 Possess the technical knowledge and expertise relevant to the position.
SC5 Demonstrated capacity to provide advice and support to management in respect to the work area.
SC6 Demonstrated commitment to professional learning and growth for both self and others.
Role
Performs and/or supervises tasks that are carried out in accordance with guidelines, accepted practice and school policy. This may include the supervision and coordination of other education support class staff within the work area or educational program. Supervision and coordination would be limited to ensuring routine tasks are performed to required standards. Input into identifying training needs and development of education support class staff within the work area or educational program becomes an important feature at range 2.
Specialised support to achieve specific outcomes is a feature of range 2. Typically this will involve accountability for a single function, (e.g. ensuring data is properly maintained) or the operation of a work area (e.g. managing the day to day operation of a school office) under the direction of the principal or another senior manager.
Provides support to teachers and students that is beyond the routine support provided at education support class Level 1, range 1. Within an educational program assists teachers with the coordination of the support function, such as directing/organising the work of other support staff or providing a specialist support role.
Undertakes medical intervention support tasks or other specialised student/teacher support roles that require specific training that must be updated from time to time. The role is for a specific purpose for which there will be direct accountability as opposed to support roles that are carried out by a range of staff performing routine tasks under direction.
Performs technical tasks that require a sound knowledge of basic technical and/or scientific principles that are used to develop and adapt work methods and make judgements where there are clear guidelines and limited options. Routine technical support in libraries, science and information technology laboratories would be typical examples.
An education support class position supports the educational services being provided to students, but must not include duties of teaching as defined in clause 2.6.1 of the Education and Training Reform Act 2006 (Vic) or its successor. Supervision of students cannot be required except where it is an integral part of the employee's position or involves supervision of students individually or in small groups, in controlled circumstances, where the responsibility for students remains clearly with a teacher.

Participate in planning and preparation with teachers on a regular basis.
Participate in professional learning activities provided through this initiative.
